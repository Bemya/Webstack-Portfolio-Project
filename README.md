#  Q&A platform for Alx SE Students

stackoverflow.com clone web app that is built using React.js and Node.js

# Motivation

We wanted to recreate the stackoverflow.com website using node for the back end and react for the front end.

# Description

For the back end, we used Express for the server and MySql for the database. My REST-API is serving the Home page from the database.

For the front end, We wanted to make it simple and aesthetic at the sametime.
